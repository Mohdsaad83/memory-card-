Initialize game board with an even number of cards (pairs of matching cards)
Shuffle the cards randomly
Set all cards to "face down"
Set score to 0
Set matched_pairs to 0
Set total_pairs = number_of_cards / 2

WHILE matched_pairs < total_pairs DO
    Display current state of the board
    PROMPT player to choose first card (input: position1)
    
    IF position1 is already matched or face up THEN
        DISPLAY "Invalid choice. Pick a different card."
        CONTINUE to next iteration
    
    Reveal card at position1
    
    PROMPT player to choose second card (input: position2)

    IF position2 is the same as position1 OR already matched or face up THEN
        DISPLAY "Invalid choice. Pick a different card."
        Hide card at position1
        CONTINUE to next iteration

    Reveal card at position2

    IF card at position1 == card at position2 THEN
        DISPLAY "Match found!"
        Mark both cards as matched
        Increment score
        Increment matched_pairs
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "Not a match."
        Wait for a moment (to let player see cards)
        Hide both cards again

END WHILE

DISPLAY "Congratulations! All pairs matched."
DISPLAY final score
